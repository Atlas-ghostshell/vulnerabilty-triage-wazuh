  - The vulnerability is low-risk due to being local and requiring user interaction
-  Hardened system by ensuring no GUI-related services are exposed unnecessarily

## Tools Used

- *Wazuh SIEM* for real-time CVE detection and vulnerability status tracking
- *APT package manager* to upgrade, patch, and verify affected packages
- *dpkg & apt-cache* for manual version validation
- *Manual triage workflow* using CVSS and CVE intelligence
